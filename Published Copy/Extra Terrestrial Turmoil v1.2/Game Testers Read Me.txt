To my game testers,

Thank you for testing out the game for me. I feel like the game has serious bugs lurking around I just can't find them.
I have a feeling that most of the easy to find bugs will be in 2 player modes since I've made a bunch of changes lately
only while playing 1 player. If you see a bug, please post it in the comments and if it's serious I'll fix it up.

Also, comment your highscores with proof and I'll add your name to the high scores list replacing the titan and zeus bs

If you have any ideas on how to improve the game please let me know!


Currently Known Bugs:
Fixable:
- Sound volume is out of wack. Shooting sounds are too low
- Power ups have crappy white boundaries. fixable, but time consuming
- Dialog windows do not have button sounds unlike the main form
- Highscores do not push downward, they only replace

NonFixable:
- Image can't overlap using transparency. Too much work to fix
- Shooting diagonal. Too much work to make happen
- 2 players tends to lag if there are too many objects moving. No clue on how to fix. I blame it on using winforms to make a game.


If you've read this far then here's a treat:

Hold down the left and right movement buttons and use up and down to navigate. This is like a turrent mode and it makes the game truly amazing. Also, you can shoot as fast as you can press the button. I like to use two fingers on the space bar.
